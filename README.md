### Introduction
- Exercises for web frontend development
    - Summarize and reorganize what I've learnt about web frontend
    - These are new products written by me. NO labs or homework here.

### Unsolved Problems
- Sticky footer with CSS grid
    - Possible issues (item hidden by footer)
- Font size
    - 3 column layout, why main page content will affect the font size of aside?
        - aside font-size is set to large
