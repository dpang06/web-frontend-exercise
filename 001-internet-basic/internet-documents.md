## IETF and RFC
[IETF: About](https://www.ietf.org/about/)
> ...The technical work of the IETF is done in Working Groups, which are organized by topic into several Areas. Much of the work is handled via mailing lists.

[IETF: Open records](https://www.ietf.org/about/open-records/)
> [Datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/). Through this tool you can find public data on all of our published documents (RFCs and Internet-Drafts), working groups and teams, meetings and proceedings, IPR disclosures, liaison statements and statistics. There are also details of how to use the datatracker API to access data programmatically.

> [Mail Archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/). This allows you to search the archives of all of our public mailing lists. It provides a unique and permanent URL for every email message received.

> [RFC Editor website](https://www.rfc-editor.org/). This provides access to all RFCs in a variety of formats through a number of mechanisms.

> This website. Additionally, our website has pages on meetings (past and upcoming), policies and groups/teams.

        - > In more technical terms, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) helps coordinate the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, which are key technical services critical to the continued operations of the Internet's underlying address book, the Domain Name System (DNS). 
        - > The IANA functions include: (1) the coordination of the assignment of technical protocol parameters including the management of the address and routing parameter area (ARPA) top-level domain; (2) the administration of certain responsibilities associated with Internet DNS root zone management such as generic (gTLD) and country code (ccTLD) Top-Level Domains; (3) the allocation of Internet numbering resources; and (4) other services.
